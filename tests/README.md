To add a test, search the database file for existing runtime + runtimeVersion. A null runtimeVersion means you can put any random numbers there from any version of that runtime.

Add a unique tags object to the set of random numbers.

Use the default exported function in "./getRandomNumbersFromDatabase.ts" to query for your numbers.
